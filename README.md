Code and assignment repository for the Imperial College Mathematics department Deep Learning course

## Course description

Deep Learning is a fast-evolving field in artificial intelligence that has been driving breakthrough advances in many application areas in recent years. It has become one of the most in-demand skillsets in machine learning and AI, far exceeding the supply of people with an expertise in this field. This course is aimed at PhD students within the Mathematics department at Imperial College who have no prior knowledge or experience of the field. It will cover the foundations of Deep Learning, including the various types of neural networks used for supervised and unsupervised learning. Practical tutorials in Tensorflow are an integral part of the course, and will enable students to build and train their own deep neural networks for a range of applications. The course also aims to describe the current state-of-the-art in various areas of Deep Learning, theoretical underpinnings and outstanding problems.

Topics covered in this course will include: 

* Convolutional and recurrent neural networks
* Reinforcement Learning
* Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
* Variational autoencoders (VAEs)
* Theoretical foundations of Deep Learning

There is a course website where registrations can be made and further logistical details can be found [here](https://www.deeplearningmathematics.com).

This repository contains the relevant code for the Tensorflow tutorials as well as details for the coursework, for students that wish to take this course for credit.
